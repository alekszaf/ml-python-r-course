print('Hello world')

x <- 2
x <- 3 # You can also use '=' to assign a variable, but it is 'frowned upon'

y <- c(1,2,3,4,5) # Creates an array of numbers with concatination oprator 'c'
y <- 1:10 # Same result as above

x <- y <- 1:10 # Create two arrays of the same length

x + y # Add two arrays: each element from one array will be added to the corresponding element of the second array
